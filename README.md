# BicycleGAN
A delira compatible skeleton for BicycleGAN used for paired multi-modal image-to-image translation.
This repository is a tensorflow implementation of the paper [Toward Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11586).

[Delira](https://github.com/delira-dev/delira) is a deep learning library which facilates data-loading, data sampling, augmentations, training routine, training monitoring and so on. `Note`: This code was developed on 'tf_features' branch of Delira (version 0.1.3).
